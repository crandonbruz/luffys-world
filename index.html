                    <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Cruz and I am a student in the University of Central Florida bootcamp. I am taking this course to enhanse my skills as a web devloper. I would like to do this as a career and I felt this was the best route to take. Here I have some of the projects I have made as well as links to my information. <br>
                    One of my passions is baseball. I have been playing since I was 3 years old and I am currently training to play professional baseball. I love the challenge of the game. I work very hard every single day to be as successful as I have become in this sport. I know my time will come. My perserverence throughout this sport will guide me through my career in the software engineering field. As long as I work hard like I do with my passion, I can achieve anything. </p>
